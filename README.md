## SimpleCalculator
An Android app built as practice for Android development. The layout of the app is based on the vertical math problem layout commonly taught in elementary school for learning addition, subtraction, and multiplication of large numbers. But this app also supports division and modulus, using straight Java arithmetic for all the functions. I have found myself using this app when debugging Java applications as it allows me to conveniently see exactly what the Java result of a calculation would be (especially for modulus, which has two possible behaviors by implementation when dealing with negative results, and it's easy to forget which implementation a specific language or calculator uses.)

## Specifications
